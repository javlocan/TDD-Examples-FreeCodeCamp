# TDD-Examples-FreeCodeCamp

I will use this repository to show my work with Test Driven Development approach. The exercises are extracted from FreeCodeCamp JavaScript's Algorythm and Structure course and Coding Interview Prep course. These are quite simple examples, basic enough to help me learn the fundamentals of TDD.

## 0. Testing technology: Vitest

This is the one I saw in *midudev*'s  (a really good teacher streamer of React and JS fundamentals) youtube course. I also have found vite an easy tool to use and was looking forward to try more products of theirs.

## 1. First reflections: convertToRoman.js example

I quite enjoy how this approach forces you to build something basic and makes you think about the problem from the easiest, simplest implementation to the more complex and complete. I end up with a greater understanding of what I'm doing with the code than when I don't use TDD.

One could say it's slower, but it actually helped solving the obstacles I found on my first attempt. I spent more time coding and less time thinking while staring at the screen. Overall I'd say I finished in less time that I'd have spent without TDD.

At the moment, it's all advantages.

I predict that it will be specially helpful with complex problems. Complex in the sense of 'elaborate, difficult to manage all at once', similar to this example, rather than 'cognitively demanding' as in recursivity problems.

## 2. checkCashRegister exercise

For this one it was harder to design the tests. Also, I had to do a weird thing to control the fload decimals that I'm completely sure it's bad practice. I still don't understand what originated the issue that makes things like 0.07-0.02 return 0.0499999996 and similar. If you know why, please DM me :) 

## 2. telephoneCheck exercise

I had a lot of doubts about how to approach this exercise. Firstly I thought of making the default return false and managing the conditions that were true, but in the end I think I made the right decision. This was a clear example of the thinking process of TDD, because I had to imagine different cases for the test. I just aimed to the tests and requirements of the original. I still think I could have done a better job, but I don't find very useful spending more time on this example right now.
