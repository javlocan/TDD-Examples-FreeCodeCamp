## TDD-Examples-FreeCodeCamp

I will use this repository to show my work with Test Driven Development approach. The exercises are extracted from FreeCodeCamp JavaScript course. These are quite simple examples, basic enough to help me learn the fundamentals of TDD.

# 1. First reflections: convertToRoman.js example

I quite enjoy how this approach forces you to build something basic and makes you think about the problem from the easiest, simplest implementation to the more complex and complete. I end up with a greater understanding of what I'm doing with the code than when I don't use TDD.

One could say it's slower, but it actually helped solving the obstacles I found on my first attempt. I spent more time coding and less time thinking while staring at the screen. Overall I'd say I finished in less time that I'd have spent without TDD.

At the moment, it's all advantages.

I predict that it will be specially helpful with complex problems. Complex in the sense of 'elaborate, difficult to manage all at once', similar to this example, rather than 'cognitively demanding' as in recursivity problems.
